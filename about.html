    <p>Motionless in White is an American heavy metal band from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Formed in 2005, the band
        consists of Chris "Motionless" Cerulli (lead vocals), Ryan Sitkowski (lead guitar), Rick "Horror" Olson (rythm
        guitar), Vinny Mauro (drums). and Justin Morrow (bass). The band has stated that their band name derived from
        the Eighteen Visions song "Motionless and White". </p>
    <p>Motionless in White was signed to Fearless Records for their first three studio albums; their fourth album,
        Graveyard Shift, was released in May 2017 through Roadrunner Records. Their most recent fifth album, Disguise,
        was released in June 2019.</p>
    <p>Motionless in White was founded in 2005 by members Chris Motionless, who played guitar and lead vocals, Angelo
        Parente on drums, Frank Polumbo on guitar and Kyle White on bass during high school. They incepted many other
        titles into the group until finally settling on what would be Motionless in White. Chris Motionless and other
        members have noted bands such as Poison the Well, Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Johnny Cash, Depeche Mode, and other
        musical groups as their inspiration. In 2005, they released their self-distributed demo.</p>
    <p>Within the year after the release of their demo, new member Josh Balz was added as the band's keyboardist, Frank
        Polumbo took over on bass and new members, Michael Costanza and Thomas "TJ" Bell, were added to the band as the
        new guitarists, moving Chris Motionless solely to lead vocals. The band was discovered by Zach Neil while
        performing at a local nightclub called The Staircase. Neil signed the band first to management and then later to
        his record label Masquerade recordings. They recorded their first EP The Whorror which was produced by Zach Neil
        and mixed by Dan Malsch and released it through Masquerade Recordings/Warner music group in 2007.</p>
    <p>After touring in support of The Whorror, Motionless in White had written enough songs to complete a full-length
        album. The album was named When Love Met Destruction. When Love Met Destruction was recorded in 2008 initially
        at Soundmine recording studio then finished at Zach Neil's home by Dave Cutrone and Zach Neil, and was released
        the same year on Masquerade Recordings. Neil added the band to his stage on the Warped tour with the new record
        in hand and the band quickly caught the attention of Shawn Milke from Alesana who offered to manage the band.
        Shortly thereafter Bob Becker of Fearless Records contacted Zach Neil to make an offer to buy the band's
        recording contract and sign the band to Fearless. The band and Neil agreed and Tragic Hero was
        offered to incubate the first official release to help grow the band leading up to their Fearless debut. The
        band was never actually signed to Tragic Hero Records.</p>
